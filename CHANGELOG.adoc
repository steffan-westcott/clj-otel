All `clj-otel-*` module versions are released in lockstep to Clojars.

`x.y.z` versions listed below do not follow semantic versioning.
Instead, development proceeds on a linear path where `z` increases for batches of incremental changes and `y` increases (with `z` reset to `0`) when milestones are reached.

The changes are marked as follows:

- [BREAK] is a breaking change in behaviour that requires user action to accommodate for when upgrading from a previous version
- [ADD] is an addition of a new feature
- [FIX] is a bug fix
- [MAINT] is a maintenance change for general improvement and proactive avoidance of potential issues

WARNING: Until version `1.0.0` there is a greater possibility of breaking changes.

== `0.x` changes

=== `0.2.10` (in progress)

- [FIX] Fixed some cases where HTTP route data was not set correctly when using the instrumentation agent.
- [ADD] New option `:prop-overrides` on `steffan-westcott.clj-otel.sdk.autoconfigure/init-otel-sdk!` to override default config values.
- Bump deps
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.54.1`, instrumentation `2.20.1-alpha`

=== `0.2.9` (2025-09-15)

- [FIX] [BREAK] Added option `:set-bound-context?` to `server-span-interceptors`, with default `false`.
Previously, bound context was always set, which prevented correct use of current context in subsequent processing.
- [FIX] In HTTP server spans, ensure values of multiple request headers with same name are captured as an array.
Also, do not normalize `-` to `_` in header names.
- [FIX] More robust processing of potentially incomplete Ring request maps to extract server span attributes.
- [FIX] To ensure HTTP/2 compatibility, read server name and port from Ring request map rather than `Host` header, which is mandatory in HTTP/1.1 only.
- [FIX] Pass HTTP route data to the instrumentation agent when present.
This ensures measurements captured by the agent for HTTP server span metrics have the `http.route` attribute.
- [FIX] Ensure provided interceptors correctly set attributes for manually created HTTP server span metrics.
- [FIX] Do not include app-root in server span names.
- [FIX] Set minimal version of Clojure dependency in `clj-otel` modules to 1.10.3.
- [ADD] New macros for wrapping spans around asynchronous code, using bound or explicit context.
Support is provided for several async libraries:
* `core.async`: Macros `chan-span/async-bound-chan-span` and `chan-span/chan-span-binding`
* `CompletableFuture` compatible such as `auspex`, `promesa` and `whew`: Macros `span/async-bound-cf-span` and `span/cf-span-binding`
* `Manifold`: Macros `d-span/async-bound-d-span` and `d-span/d-span-binding`
* `Missionary`: Macro `task-span/task-span-binding`
- [ADD] Refactored and extended microservice examples to demonstrate the new macros supporting async spans.
- [ADD] New example `anonymise-app` that demonstrates async spans with several async libraries.
- [ADD] New example `word-stream-app` that demonstrates manual instrumentation of a `core.async.flow` application.
- [ADD] By default, populate `code.function.name` attribute to name of function containing the start of each span.
This is implemented using the StackWalker API for performance reasons, starting in Java 9.
If StackWalker is not available, the attribute is not populated.
- [ADD] Updated `span/new-span!` to provide defaults for source location, similar to other functions and macros that
create spans. Note: `new-span!` is now a macro.
- [ADD] New middleware `span/wrap-span` and `span/wrap-bound-span` to create a span around subsequent processing.
These can be used as an alternative to the deprecated `wrap-exception-event` to record uncaught exceptions before they are transformed.
- Bump deps
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.54.0`, semconv `1.37.0`, instrumentation `2.20.0-alpha`

=== `0.2.8` (2025-05-22)

- [ADD] Updated microservices examples to export logs to Grafana Loki.
A `Logs` panel has been added to the `HTTP server instances` dashboard.
- Bump deps
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.50.0`, semconv `1.32.0`, instrumentation `2.16.0-alpha`
** [BREAK] Deprecated `wrap-exception-event` and `exception-event-interceptor`.
These will be stubbed out and later removed in future releases.
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/exception/#exception-escaped[OpenTelemetry no longer recommends to record non-escaping exceptions.]
** [BREAK] `add-exception!` and `add-interceptor-exception!` now assume the exception is escaping the span's scope i.e. former option `:escaping?` is true.
** [ADD] `memory-mode` option for programmatically configured OTLP exporters.
** [ADD] `capture-gc-cause` option for JVM runtime garbage collection metrics, for both Java 8 and Java 17 instrumentation.
** [BREAK] `retry-policy` default changed (from disabled) for programmatically configured OTLP exporters.
** [ADD] Added `steffan-westcott.clj-otel.api.baggage/get-entry`
** For all `clj-otel` functions which create a span such as `with-span!`, optional entries in `:source` map have changed:
*** [BREAK] `:fn` should be the fully qualified function name
*** [MAINT] Support for `:ns` has been deprecated and removed
*** [ADD] `:col` is the source column number
* [ADD] `:getter` and `:setter` options to generalise context propagation functions `->headers` and `headers->merged-context` for use  in applications other than Ring HTTP servers.
* [ADD] Programmatic configuration of log record exporters used for debugging.
* [BREAK] Pedestal `0.7.0` in microservices examples.
Pedestal `0.7.0` introduces its own support for OpenTelemetry, including a new interceptor `io.pedestal.http.tracing/request-tracing-interceptor`.
This overlaps functionality with `clj-otel` interceptors, so should be disabled by setting `:io.pedestal.http/tracing` to `nil` in the Pedestal service map.
* [MAINT] Clojure `1.12.0` However `clj-otel` retains compatibility with Clojure `1.10.3` and later.

=== `0.2.7` (2024-07-01)

- Bump deps
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.39.0`
** [ADD] Support for creating and setting gauges that take measurements synchronously.
Use `steffan-westcott.clj-otel.api.metrics.instrument/set!` to synchronously set a gauge to a given measurement.
** [ADD] Option to set explicit bucket boundaries advice for histograms
** [ADD] `:links` option for `add-span-data!`
** [FIX] `metrics-by-route-interceptors` should record requests that have 404 HTTP response code
** [BREAK] Removed modules `clj-otel-exporter-jaeger-grpc` and `clj-otel-exporter-jaeger-thrift` as the Java libraries `opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger` and `opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger-thrift` are no longer published.
Jaeger has native support for OTLP, use `clj-otel-exporter-otlp` instead to configure an OTLP exporter.
** [BREAK] In module `clj-otel-exporter-zipkin`, `span-exporter` options `:sender` and `:encoder` now take `zipkin2.reporter.BytesMessageSender` and `zipkin2.codec.BytesEncoder` values
* [MAINT] Various build deps
- Refactored microservice examples
** [MAINT] Removed uberjar build step.
All application instances now use a `clojure` Docker image rather than custom image containing an uberjar.
** [ADD] For telemetry backend, changed to use Grafana with Grafana Tempo and Prometheus.
Preconfigured Grafana dashboards for metrics and traces are included.
** [ADD] Added state lifecycle management, using `with-open` and `closeable` pattern.
** [MAINT] Altered Ring/Pedestal servers to reload routes on every HTTP request.
** [ADD] Added embedded nREPL server to all application and load-gen instances for remote access.
- [ADD] Example `rpg-service` with instrumented database access
- [FIX] Updated examples and guide when using `wrap-metrics-by-route` to also wrap Reitit default handler.
This ensures correct recording of metrics for HTTP server spans with 404, 405 and 406 response codes.

=== `0.2.6` (2024-01-15)

- Bump deps
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.34.1`
* [BREAK] OpenTelemetry instrumentation agent `2.0.0`
The default OTLP exporter protocol used by the agent has changed from `grpc` to `http/protobuf`.
See the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/tag/v2.0.0[release notes] for details on this and other breaking changes.
Note the default OTLP exporter protocol used by the autoconfigure SDK extension remains as `grpc`.
* [MAINT] Various build deps

=== `0.2.5` (2024-01-01)

- [FIX] Queried header names in  context propagator text maps (for manually instrumented applications) should be lower-cased.
Previously, `b3multi` and `xray` propagators would fail because header names in Ring `request` maps are lower-cased but the queried header name may not.
- [ADD] Module `clj-otel-sdk-common` which wraps the OpenTelemetry SDK common library.
- [BREAK] Moved function `merge-resources-with-default` to new module `clj-otel-sdk-common`.
- [ADD] Terse syntax alternatives for `span-opts` map parameter in `new-span!` and related functions that create spans.
- [ADD] Convenience function `add-event!` to add an event to the bound or current span.
- [ADD] Populate `err.type` trace semantic attribute on manually created client and server spans.
- [ADD] Middleware `wrap-compojure-route` that adds the matched Compojure route to the server span and request map.
- [MAINT] Ensure example microservices uberjars are built and run on the same JDK.
- Bump deps
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.33.0`
* [MAINT] Various build deps

=== `0.2.4.1` (2023-10-01)

- [ADD] Module `clj-otel-sdk-extension-autoconfigure` which wraps the autoconfigure OpenTelemetry SDK extension.
Updated guide on using the autoconfigure module and adding initialisation code to application.
- [ADD] Updated functions to use a default `OpenTelemetry` instance declared by `clj-otel`, falling back to the global `OpenTelemetry` instance declared by Java OpenTelemetry if no default instance was previously configured.
Added recommendation to prefer use of default `OpenTelemetry` instance over the global `OpenTelemetry` instance, when using autoconfigure module or programmatic configuration of SDK.
Use of system property `otel.java.global-autoconfigure.enabled` or environment variable `OTEL_JAVA_GLOBAL_AUTOCONFIGURE_ENABLED` is discouraged.
- [BREAK] `steffan-westcott.clj-otel.sdk.otel-sdk/init-otel-sdk!` has a new option `register-shutdown-hook` enabled by default.
- [ADD] New middleware (formerly part of the microservices examples)
* `wrap-exception-event` adds an exception event to the server span.
This is intended for use by applications which transform the exception to an HTTP response in a subsequent middleware.
* `wrap-reitit-route` adds the matched Reitit route to the server span and request map.
- [ADD] New interceptor `exception-event-interceptor` adds an exception event to the server span.
This is intended for use by applications which transform the exception to an HTTP response in a subsequent interceptor.
- [ADD] Function `steffan-westcott.clj-otel.instrumentation.runtime-telemetry-java8/close!` to stop JVM telemetry.
`steffan-westcott.clj-otel.instrumentation.runtime-telemetry-java8/register!` now returns a collection of `AutoCloseable`.
- [MAINT] Removed `:dev` alias for development.
- [MAINT] Reworked examples to be easier to run.
Added load generator applications to microservices examples.
- Bump deps:
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.30.1`
** [BREAK] `clj-otel-exporter-jaeger-*` are now deprecated, use `clj-otel-exporter-otlp` instead
* [BREAK] Now using `io.opentelemetry.semconv/opentelemetry-semconv` semantic conventions.
This impacts manually instrumented HTTP server applications using `clj-otel` middleware or interceptors, as several semantic attributes have changed.
* [MAINT] Various build deps

=== `0.2.3` (2023-06-18)

- [ADD] Support for programmatic configuration of `MeterProvider` for metrics export.
- [ADD] Module `clj-otel-exporter-prometheus` for programmatic configuration of metrics export to Prometheus
- [FIX] `steffan-westcott.clj-otel.util/duration` should convert `[amount ^TimeUnit unit]` to `Duration`
- Bump deps:
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.27.0`
** [BREAK] The default value for autoconfiguration property `otel.logs.exporter` has changed from `none` to `otlp`
** [BREAK] Module `clj-otel-instrumentation-runtime-metrics` has been renamed and split into modules `clj-otel-instrumentation-runtime-telemetry-java8` and `clj-otel-instrumentation-runtime-telemetry-java17`

=== `0.2.2` (2023-06-05)

- [ADD] Opt-in feature xref:doc/concepts.adoc#_bound_context[bound context], a Clojure dynamic var that overrides the default `context` or `parent` parameter value for `clj-otel` functions.
This feature is intended to simplify asynchronous code by eliminating explicit context passing.
Existing code that uses the current context or explicit context parameter values is unaffected.
- [FIX] Convert key names of entries added to OpenTelemetry attributes to snake_case.
This applies to resources, spans and metrics.
- [FIX] Do not transform key names of entries added to OpenTelemetry context or baggage.
- [ADD] Function `set-attribute-name-fn!` to override setting of OpenTelemetry attribute key names.
- [MAINT] Remove Jaeger exporters from examples, since they will be deprecated soon.
The Jaeger Collector now accepts OTLP directly.
See the https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.45/client-libraries/#deprecating-jaeger-clients[Jaeger clients deprecation notice].
- Bump deps:
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry contrib `1.26.0-alpha`

- [ADD] Support for Metrics API
- [ADD] Implementations of the following https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/metrics/semantic_conventions/http-metrics/[HTTP server metrics] for use by applications not run with the OpenTelemetry instrumentation agent:
* `http.server.active_requests`
* `http.server.duration`
* `http.server.request.size`
- [BREAK] The parameters for function `add-route-data!` have changed, there is a new parameter to specify the HTTP request method.
- [BREAK] The pattern for using `clj-otel` middleware and interceptors in applications has been revised.
The revised pattern adds new middleware `wrap-route`, `wrap-active-requests` and
`wrap-metrics-by-route` and interceptors `route-interceptor`, `active-requests-interceptor` and `metrics-by-route-interceptors` to capture matched routes in HTTP server spans and HTTP server metrics.
The pattern also ensures all requests are recorded, including those which do not match any route.
- [ADD] Module `clj-otel-instrumentation-runtime-metrics` to provide access to JVM runtime metrics instrumentation for applications not using the OpenTelemetry instrumentation agent.
- [ADD] Aliases in examples
** `:metrics-*` to control export of metrics
** `:logging-*` to control application logging
- Bump deps:
* [MAINT] OpenTelemetry `1.25.0`
** [BREAK] When using autoconfiguration for a manually instrumented application, include the new JVM option `"-Dotel.java.global-autoconfigure.enabled=true"` or environment variable setting `OTEL_JAVA_GLOBAL_AUTOCONFIGURE_ENABLED=true`
** Methods to statically set the server host name attribute on server spans have been removed, as static data is better represented as an OpenTelemetry resource.
*** [BREAK] The function `add-server-name!` has been removed.
*** [BREAK] The option `:server-name` has been removed from the middleware and interceptors for server span support.
** [BREAK] Module `clj-otel-extension-aws` renamed to `clj-otel-contrib-aws-xray-propagator`
